National Environmental Modeling System (NEMS) Version 1.1 (August 2008)
======================================

	-Employs ESMF superstructure & utilities
	-Separate dynamics, physics, and coupler grid components & import/export states
	-Digital filtering capabilities added
	-Adiabatic (dynamics only) simulation capability
	-Enhanced postprocessing capability

How to compile and run?
-----------------------

- In NEMS directory, a single executable is created using a single compile option: 

	 make all
	 make cleans (removes source code copies, object files, modules, NEMS library files, and executables)

-Executable MAIN_NEMS.x created in ${USER}/NEMS 

-run directory contains run scripts, configure files and error/output log directories.
	
	-configfile_global_new: master config file  
		 
		core: nmm - all of the other file entries are read in my NEMS
		core: gfs - rest of the file entries are ignored and NEMS reads in the run information from the file exglobal_fcst.sh.sms_nems 
	
 	-exglobal_fcst.sh.sms_nems: gfs core control file

	-gfs_prep_test3, gfs_prep_test3, gfs_prep_test3: scripts used to setup up run directories and files needed prior to running NEMS tests using the gfs core option.
	-run_gfs_test1, run_gfs_test2, run_gfs_test3: scripts used to run the NEMS tests using the gfs core option.

	-run_nmm_test1, run_nmm_test2, run_nmm_test3: scripts used to run the NEMS tests using the nmm core option. 

	-gfs_out: directory containing ouput and error files created during the last NEMS run in which the gfs core option was selected
	
	-nmm_out: directory containing ouput and error files created during the last NEMS run in which the nmm core option was selected
